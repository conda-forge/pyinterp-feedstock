  summary: 'Python library for optimized geo-referenced interpolation'

  description: |
    Tools for interpolating geo-referenced data used in the field of
    geosciences. There are other libraries that cover this problem, but written
    entirely in Python, the performance of these projects was not quite
    sufficient for our needs. That is why this project was created.
